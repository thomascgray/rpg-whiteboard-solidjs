# Barnabus VTT

Barnabus VTT is like [Miro](https://miro.com/app/dashboard/) or [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/) or [Microsoft Whiteboard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-whiteboard/digital-whiteboard-app), but for **tabletop RPGs**.

## Technology Stack

Barnabus VTT is built with:

- [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## General Architecture Notes

- `src\app.tsx` loads everything in and sets up global event handlers
- all the objects get rendered with `src\components\board-objects\base.tsx`
- various ephemeral UI components (the selection box, the resize handles, etc.) are in `src\components\in-camera-ui`
- various on clicks on objects and from App are handled in `src\event-handlers.ts` and determine what should happen based on what buttons a user is pressing, if they already have selected objects, etc.
- the actual specific interactions that should take place are then handled in `src/interaction-handlers.ts`; moving objects, resizing objects, etc.

So a typical interaction flow is;

- moving the mouse around -> triggering the `onWindowMouseMove` and in turn, an interaction handler such as `interactionMoveObjects`
- letting go of the mouse -> triggering the `onWindowMouseUp`, which may trigger further interaction handlers

And all of those event and interaction handlers read and write state, read and write DOM nodes, etc.

## "Easily Forgotten" Features TODO

- locking objects
  - done very quick prototype, super broke, fix this up
  - its a bit better?
- grouping objects
- map markers?

- dynamic lighting examples/inspo
  https://codepen.io/loktar00/pen/kYVbPz
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/visibility-polygon

- send to back
- bring to front
- borders
- opacity
  - for objects, probably?
  - for the sketching pen, maybe just make a highlighter tool
- rounding/cropping

- when you're dragging an object mark it as dragging, so we DONT show its toolbar

- when the selected toolbar goes offscreen, maybe it should stay on screen? like right click menus in other apps

## Refactor TODO

- The resize utils code has become extremely gross, refactor the shit out of this.
- the text box objects _kinda_ work, _mostly_. but things get super fucky when you resize them, could do with going back to this at some point.
- stop firing global key events when focused on a text box, all sorts of bugs to do with hitting delete and stuff.
- the dynamic lighting needs to take into account only the tokens and walls inside the image thats relevant
- sometimes deleting walls doesn't delete wall anchors correctly, and vice versa
- when something is invisible we need it so that drag select doesn't select it

## Motion Effects Notes

  the clouds and twinkling, very sick

  fireflys, change colour, weird magic?

### Performance Notes

**if we get rid of using state as the core, we dont need the pre stuff. the state IS the pre stuff, and we just change against the dom directly**

https://write.as/browserboard-blog/browserboard-update-everything-is-faster

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25910500/1000-dom-elements-on-a-single-page

the browser is VERY sensitive to dom nodes - maybe its nested dom nodes?

when each object is like this:

```html
<div>
  <img />
</div>
```

it works MUCH faster than when each object is like this:

```html
<div>
  <img />
  <p>debug info</p>
  <p>debug info</p>
  <p>debug info</p>
  <p>debug info</p>
</div>
```

thats something we should take into account - hiding DOM nodes when
they're effectively too small

---

average BitD charactr is 60 to 100 objects - the main sheet, then a bunch of dots, etc.

by the end of the bitd campaign, the entire board was 1588 objects, including all characters, etc.

https://github.com/wilsonpage/fastdom ???

---

maybe we should start doing mad shit like keeping all selected object dom nodes on the window so we don't have to recompute, etc.
update: we did this, it works great, may god have mercy on our souls

---

so doing a test with 100 image objects.....
when they're all bunched up on top of each other, chrome's performance drops to a crawl
but when they're literally spread out and not on top of each other, everything is fine.
very interesting, i wonder if this is a limitation in chrome itself.

---

bunch more testing;
from what i can tell, chromes insane performance problems are literally only when theres like 50+ images stacked on top
of each other AND they're taking up the whole screen
which, i mean, will never happen? so fuck it?
i tried with 2000 objects, 500ish more than the average BitD board and performance was not amazing, not shit. i think we're fine

<!-- ok more testing -->

alright, 6 months later, im back

so as you can see in src\utils\testing-utils.ts i've done some testing making loads of objects live just next to each other not QUITE overlapping
and the problem definitely IS overlapping
like, performance isnt _great_ with 2000 things, but with 100 stacked directly on top of each other its literally unusable
for example, with 500 stacked directly on top of each other, the app literally struggles to zoom out

- changing file type to jpeg doesnt help

things that do help performance, generally speaking

- putting `pointer-events-none` on everything that you're not gonna click
